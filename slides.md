Welcome to a journey through the mystical art of writing **unmaintainable** code. 

**Guarantee** your job for life - because **no one else** will dare to touch your code!

Let's get started?!

---

-> # Why you should write Unmaintainable Code? <-

- **Job Security:** The more confusing your code, the more indispensable you become. Ever heard of **Tribal Knowledge**?

- **Challenge:** Test the limits of your ingenuity in obfuscation.
  
- **Fun:** Let's be honest, it's amusing to watch others struggle with your creative genius.
^

Ready to dive into the **art of confusion**?

---

-> `src/0_naming_conventions.py` <-

- Keep them **guessing** what each variable and function does!
^

- This is just a **simple factorial function**, but the naming conventions make it look like a complex space travel simulation.

---

-> `src/1_documentation.py` <-

- Provide **general and unhelpful comments** like `Data transformation phase 1` and `Final output preparation`.

- **Avoid** explaining the purpose behind specific operations or logic.

- Use comments to give a **false sense of understanding**, while the actual code remains cryptic.

---

-> `src/2_code_structure.py` <-

- Nest conditions like **Russian dolls**
  
- The **deeper**, the **better**.

---


-> `src/3_inconsistent_style.py` <-

- Mix **camelCase** and **snake_case** in function and variable names.
  
- Use **inconsistent capitalization** in class and method names.
  
- Combine **different naming conventions** within the same code block, making it hard to follow a consistent style.

---


-> `src/4_magic_numbers.py` <-

- Use numbers like `42, 17, 23, 13, 3.14, 2.718` without any explanation.

- Integrate these **magic numbers** into complex calculations. Why use constants when you can keep them **mystified**?

---


-> `src/5_can_you_spot_the_obfuscation.py` <-

- Examine the **private nested function** applying **bitwise** operations.
  
- Focus on how the string undergoes **transformation** and then another operation.

---

- Well, it's not that hard to figure out what this code does, but it's still confusing enough to make you wonder why it's written this way.
  
- The complexity disguises a **simple yet common** string operation.

`result = input_str[::-1]`

---

-> `src/6_overcomplicate_simple_tasks.py` <-

- Can you take a **guess** what this code does?
^

- Why make it simple when we can use recursion for a **simple even-odd** check.


- Why make it simple when we can use recursion for a **simple even-odd** check
  
- Why make it simple when we can use recursion for a **simple even-odd** check
- **Bonus points** for embeding the logic within private helper functions to further complicate the understanding.

---

-> `src/7_commenting_out_code.py` <-

- **Never delete** old code, just comment it out.
  
- It's like an **archeological dig** for future coders!
  
- Mix actual code with large commented sections to **obscure** the current functionality.

---

-> `src/8_misleading_comments.py` <-

- Comments should **seldom** match the code's purpose.
  
- **Confuse and conquer**!

---

-> `src/9_redundant_code.py` <-

- **Redundancy** is key.
  
- Let them ponder the **purpose** of your code.

---

-> `src/10_creative_use_of_data_types.py` <-

- Data types? Just a **suggestion**.
  
- Mix and match for maximum **confusion**.

---

-> `src/11_unnecessary_complexity.py` <-

- Wrap **everything** in `try-except`.
  
- ~Even~ Especially, when it's not **needed**.

---


-> `src/12_arbitrary_restrictions.py` <-

- Introduce **random** restrictions.
  
- Make them wonder why `4` is so special.

---


-> `src/13_cryptic_algorithms.py` <-

- The more **cryptic**, the **better**.
  
- Make simple algorithms look **complex**.
  
  ^

```python
def cryptic_algo(a, b):
    return a * b - a / b + a % b
```

---

-> `src/14_repetitive_code.py` <-

- Don't use `elif` or `switch`.
  
- Repetition is your ally.

---

-> `src/15_misuse_of_language.py` <-


- **Mix** languages in your code.
  
- Use variable names from **different languages** for an **international flair**.
  
- The more erratic, the better.

---

-> `src/16_redefine_standard_functions.py` <-

- Redefine len to return **half** the actual length.
  
- Change sum to return the **maximum** value instead of the sum.
  
- Alter **max** to behave like **min**, or return the first element if no key is provided.

^

> Create a **parallel universe** where nothing works as expected!

---

-> `src/17_abusing_global_variables.py` <-

- Use and modify global variables recklessly. They should be in every method!
- Watch as everyone tries to untangle the web of dependencies.
  
---

-> `src/18_overuse_design_patterns.py` <-

- Implement **design patterns** where they **aren'**t needed.
> The more complex, the better.

---


-> # Closing Thoughts <-

- Writing **unmaintainable** code is an **art** form.
- Today, you've taken your first steps to mastering this craft.
- Go forth and code (confusingly) and secure your job! 

---

-> # On a more serious note... <-

> In case you didn't get it, this talk was a **parody** based on a very old paper - "How To Write Unmaintainable Code - Ensure a job for life ;-)" by Roedy Green [1997] modified to use Python examples! 

---

-> # Please: <-

- **Don't** write unmaintainable code. Else it will be `PIP` city soon.
^

- **Do** write code that is easy to understand, collaborate and scale.

---

-> # Another thing! <-
^

> All of the code in this presentation was generated by AI using a mix of **GPT-4** and **Github Copilot** (OpenAI's Codex).

^

> The interesting aspect here is that despite this code being **highly unreadable** and **unusable** in a real-world scenario(for Humans), it is still syntactically correct and can be executed and in most cases will produce the expected output at near same performance as the optimised code. `Sharing an instance from...`.

---

> So, if you are a **junior developer** and you are struggling to understand the code written by your **senior developer**, it's not your fault.
^

> But you should use this as an opportunity to learn and improve your skills and don't be shy to supplement your knowledge using AI tools like **Github Copilot** 
^

> Do ensure your **foundation** of knowledge is **solid**, because AI tools can be **highly unreliable** while being **super confident**.

---

> Don't be naive to stick to the **old ways** of doing things, **embrace** the **better** to **improve** your **productivity**.
^

> Don't fall into the trap of being a **Real** programmer.

-> # Thank You! <-

**Any questions?**

All the code used in this presentation will be available on **Github**.

I will share the repo link shortly on **Twitter**.
