### Description
In this talk, we dive into the mystical art of writing *unmaintainable* code. We explore various strategies to obfuscate and complicate code, ensuring that no one but you can maintain it. From naming conventions to unnecessary recursion, each topic is covered with humor and wit, providing an entertaining look at coding practices to avoid.

### Contents
The repository contains the following:

- **Slides:** A comprehensive slide deck for the talk, showcasing different rules and examples of unmaintainable code.
- **Source Code:** Python examples for each of the rules discussed, demonstrating how to (not) write code.

## Using the Slide Deck
The slide deck for this talk is available in markdown format [here](SLIDES.md) and can be presented using the [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) CLI tool in the terminal. 

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `mdp` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using package managers like `apt` or `brew`:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install mdp # For Debian/Ubuntu
